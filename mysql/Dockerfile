# When a container is started for the first time, a new database with the 
# specified name will be created and initialized with the provided configuration variables.
# Furthermore, it will execute files with extensions .sh, .sql and .sql.gz that are found in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d. 
# Files will be executed in alphabetical order. You can easily populate your mysql services by mounting a SQL dump into 
#that directory and provide custom images with contributed data. SQL files will be imported by default to the 
# database specified by the MYSQL_DATABASE variable.
